# Introduction

Competitive programming was my entry point into computer science. I joined [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and more similar platforms around 2014, to practice and improve my skills, because I was having fun solving algorithmic problems, and because I was interested in mastering at least a few programming languages (for general scripting and low-level programming mainly).

## About competitive programming

For those who are not familiar with this mind-sport, it's about solving computer science problems with given constraints, for example, calculating the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime, finding the shortest path in a graph, or finding all the ways to write a number as the sum of at least three positive numbers. Each problem has some constraints (Sizes of the inputs it gets). 
The user also gets some example inputs and outputs, and should write and submit a computer program that can read inputs in the given format, solve the problem and print the corresponding outputs.
The user's submission gets executed in the cloud, and its output gets compared with the precomputed correct output of "hidden" testcases. If it's the same, the submission is considered as correct.

## Why is it important?

- Competitive programming is used as a basis for hiring by numerous companies: The first step of the hiring process is often a programming challenge to solve on a platform like [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) or [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/).
- Contests: There are a lot of them ([ACM ICPC](https://icpc.global/), [Google CodeJam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam), [Meta HackerCup](https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup) ...), just like CTFs.

## Types of failed submissions

There are different kinds of failed submissions:

- `Wrong answer`: When the output of the program is different than the expected output of the testcase.
- `Time-Limit exceeded`: When the program takes too much time to execute, execution is stopped, and this error is returned.
- `Compilation Error`: When the program doesn't compile, or contains syntax errors.
- `Runtime Error`: When the program crashes (unhandled exception, segmentation fault, or any other type of errors).

## Let's focus on time limits, what?

The `TLE`, or Time-Limit Exceeded error happens when a submission takes more than the maximum duration allocated for it. People running these platforms have figured out that comparing the execution time of programs written in different programming languages is unfair (and would give a clear advantage to C/C++ programmers for instance). For this reason, they defined a multiplier that is specific to each programming language. On Hackerrank for example, Ruby or Python submissions get an execution time that is 5 times higher than C or C++ submissions (this aims to compensate the runtime overhead).

Below are some numbers taken from the different (and most popular) competitive programming platforms at the time of writing (For platforms that can host "work" interviews, these are the configurations of the environment where candidate submissions will be executed).

# My Idea

Looking back into this common practice of having different time limits for different programming languages, I got an idea: what if I could somehow execute faster code from a slower programming language, and get an extended time limit?
While the constraints are often picked in a way that makes naive or unoptimized solutions time out, this could for example allow candidates to submit a sub-optimal solution in `C`, `C++` or `Go` (embedded in a stub written in a slower programming language), and avoid the time-limit exceeded error (because the platform would pick the time limit of the slower programming language).

## Choice for the slower programming language (for the stub)

We can choose any programming language that is considered as slow compared to `C`, and that has a builtin library that allows low-level memory hacking (calling native functions, manipulating pointers for example).

Possible choices are:

- Python with [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html).
- Ruby with [fiddle](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/fiddle/rdoc/Fiddle.html).
- Probably more.

## Initial enumeration on the different platforms

Let's first check the operating systems, kernel and libc versions on the different platforms.

We run these lines of code in `Lua` to gather informations about the execution environments.

```lua
local commands = { 'uname -a', 'id', 'ls -l /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6' };

os.execute( table.concat(commands, ' ; ') );
```

## Writing the stub

For a proof of concept, we will be doing the following:

- From the slower programming language, create an anonymous file that lives in `tmpfs` with `memfd_create`.
- Decompress and decode the payload (`zlib` and `base64`), and write it to the anonymous file (using `write`).
- Execute the anonymous file from memory using `fexecve`.

We will avoid writing data on the disk, as different environments can have different configurations, and some might not allow writing data on the disk.

## Implementing the stub

### Decompressing the native executable

```ruby
require 'fiddle'
require 'zlib'
require 'base64'

exe = <<DEFLATED
eJztW31wG8UV35PlL0gkBZLgOF8mdaYOwYoFTrBJApYtOyd6DiaxA4WYi2yd

B86MAWvWb7A6tNYT
DEFLATED

exe = Zlib.inflate(Base64.decode64(exe))
```

### Getting pointers to `memfd_create`, `write` and `fexecve`

```ruby
libc = Fiddle.dlopen('/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6');

# int memfd_create(const char *name, unsigned int flags)
memfd_create = Fiddle::Function.new(
    libc['memfd_create'],
    [Fiddle::TYPE_VOIDP, Fiddle::TYPE_INT],
    Fiddle::TYPE_INT
)

# ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
write = Fiddle::Function.new(
    libc['write'],
    [Fiddle::TYPE_INT, Fiddle::TYPE_VOIDP, Fiddle::TYPE_SIZE_T],
    Fiddle::TYPE_SSIZE_T
);

# int fexecve(int fd, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);
fexecve = Fiddle::Function.new(
    libc['fexecve'],
    [Fiddle::TYPE_INT, Fiddle::TYPE_VOIDP, Fiddle::TYPE_VOIDP],
    Fiddle::TYPE_INT
);
```

### Creating the anonymous file, and writing the binary to it

```ruby
fd = memfd_create.call('exec', 0)

written = write.call(fd, exe, exe.length)
```

### Preparing a fake `ARGV` and `ENVP` for `fexecve`

```ruby
# set argv[0] = "exec"
argv0 = Fiddle::Pointer.malloc(5)

argv0[0, 5] = 'exec' + 0.chr;

# set argv = { "exec", NULL }
argv = Fiddle::Pointer.malloc(2*Fiddle::SIZEOF_VOIDP)
argv[0,8] = [argv0.to_i].pack('Q')
argv[8,8] = 0.chr * 8

# set envp = { NULL }
envp = Fiddle::Pointer.malloc(Fiddle::SIZEOF_VOIDP)
envp[0, 8] = 0.chr * 8
```

### Calling the loaded executable

```ruby
ret = fexecve.call(fd, argv, envp)
```

## Testing with a C program that prints "hello world"

The program below runs the following C code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	puts("Hello world from C ^^");
}
```

We compress and encode it with the following lines of Ruby.

```ruby
require 'zlib'
require 'base64'

exe = File.open('exe', 'rb', &:read)
compressed = Zlib.deflate(exe)
encoded = Base64.encode64(compressed)
```

The Ruby stub with the compressed ELF embedded inside is around 100 lines of code. We will test it on the different platforms.

```ruby
require 'fiddle'
require 'zlib'
require 'base64'
exe = <<DEFLATED

It didn't work in codechef right away. It looks like libc support for `memfd_create` is not available. We can still get to call it manually:

```ruby
# void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags,
#            int fd, off_t offset);
mmap = Fiddle::Function.new(
    libc['mmap'],

## Impact, and possible mitigations

The impact of this isn't huge, because:

- Solutions that have a different time complexity are likely to take more than 5 times the duration of execution of the better ones (depending on the size of the inputs, and the time complexity), if the naive approach is an \\(O(2^n)\\) algorithm, and the optimized one \\(O(n^2)\\), the former could take thousands of times the duration of execution of the latter.
- If the code of the candidate gets reviewed, the deceit will be blatant (It's not always the case, on contests and some automated hiring processes, candidates might be able to run away with it).

However, it can give a substantial advantage over the other contenders. More memory available, and a higher time-limit for a solution written in a low-level programming language like `C` or `C++`.

Below are some possible mitigations that would solve this issue:

- A seccomp whitelist (why would a candidate call `memfd_create`, or `execve` ?!).
- Modified programming language runtimes to prevent unsafe operations (no `ctypes` module for python for example).
