      <description>The event was held from October 14th to October 18th, at the Emirates Palace at Abu Dhabi, UAE.
We were invited to participate in the Standoff, the contest was about doing penetration testing in a fictional industrial city, spanning about 17 square meters (183 square feet) and containing thousands of figurines. The mock city model allowed demonstrating consequences of real cyberattacks against critical infrastructure.</description>
