      <description>Introduction Competitive programming was my entry point into computer science. I joined Hackerrank, Codechef, Project Euler and more similar platforms around 2014, to practice and improve my skills, because I was having fun solving algorithmic problems, and because I was interested in mastering at least a few programming languages (for general scripting and low-level programming mainly).
About competitive programming For those who are not familiar with this mind-sport, it&amp;rsquo;s about solving computer science problems with given constraints, for example, calculating the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime, finding the shortest path in a graph, or finding all the ways to write a number as the sum of at least three positive numbers.</description>
