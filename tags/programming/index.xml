      <description>Table of Contents Introduction About competitive programming Why is it important? Types of failed submissions Let&amp;rsquo;s focus on time limits, what? Hackerrank CodinGame for Work Codechef My Idea Choice for the slower programming language (for the stub) Initial enumeration on the different platforms Hackerrank Codingame Codechef Writing the stub Implementing the stub Decompressing the native executable Getting pointers to memfd_create, write and fexecve Creating the anonymous file, and writing the binary to it Preparing a fake ARGV and ENVP for fexecve Calling the loaded executable Testing with a C program that prints &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; Hackerrank Codingame Codechef Impact, and possible mitigations Conclusion Introduction Competitive programming was my entry point into computer science.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents What is SHA3 Why another hash function in the SHA family? Deeper view of SHA-3 The sponge construction The internal state The Permutation function at the core of Keccak: Keccak-p Theta: \(\theta\) Rho: \(\rho\) Pi: \(\pi\) Chi: \(\chi\) Iota: \(\iota\) Inverting Keccak-p \( \theta^{-1} \): Back to linear algebra \( \rho^{-1} \): Simplier than it looks \( \pi^{-1} \): Inverse transposition \( \chi^{-1} \): Non-linearity \( \iota^{-1} \): Xor again and it&amp;rsquo;ll be done \(Keccak-p^{-1}\): Just perform the inverse operations in reverse order Example testing Implications What is SHA3 SHA3 is a family of standarised cryptographic hashing functions, it&amp;rsquo;s the winner of the 2012 NIST hash function contest.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents Introduction My Proposal Community-Bonding period Results of my contribution My Google Summer of Code journey Initial work SQLite support and specs for the library Support for PostgreSQL, and other database-management systems Conclusion Introduction Being interested in computer security, and being an opensource lover, I wanted to participate in Google Summer of Code this year, after checking out the list of organizations, I applied for Metasploit, because Ruby is my main programming language, and because I was very interested in contributing to a framework of this popularity.</description>

      <description>Algerian Collegiate Programming Contest 2018 The contest was held at University Mohamed Khider at Biskra, Algeria, from October 1st 2018 to October 3rd.
It was a programming contests, ACM ACPC qualifier. I played with the team NerDz, with students from my school, we finished on the second place, with an equal number of points as the first team (time penalty did the difference).</description>
